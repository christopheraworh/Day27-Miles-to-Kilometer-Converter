# Day27-Miles-to-Kilometer-Converter

Hi there! This is a project as part completion of my 100 Dys of code

Today its all about GUI and i am about making life a bit easier when you need to convert miles to kilometers.

I wanted to keep things simple and user-friendly, so the interface is minimalistic. You just pop your distance in miles into a text box and hit the ‘Calculate’ button—voilà, you get the distance in kilometers in a flash!
